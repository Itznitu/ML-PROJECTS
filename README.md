"""
Machine Learning with Python: Linear Regression (1 Variable)
------------------------------------------------------------

📌 Project Objective
--------------------
Build a simple yet powerful machine learning model to predict house prices based on the square feet area using Linear Regression.

📂 Dataset
----------
The project uses a dataset `houseprice.csv`, which contains:
- Input: Square feet area of a house
- Output: Corresponding house price

📝 Problem Statement:
---------------------
Given the dataset, build a model that accurately predicts home prices based on the size of the house in square feet.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
----------------------------
- Platform: JupyterLite
- Libraries:
  - pandas – for data handling
  - numpy – for numerical computations
  - matplotlib – for visualizations
  - scikit-learn – for building the linear regression model

🔍 Project Workflow
-------------------
1. Data Loading & Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Building the Model (Linear Regression)
4. Model Evaluation
5. Prediction & Visualization

📊 Sample Output
----------------
Visual plot showing:
- The original data (scatter plot)
- The fitted regression line
- Predictions for new input values
